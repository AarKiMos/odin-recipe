  <p>If you've ever had Japanese tempura-coated veggies, you'll love this recipe.
    These pakoras are similar, but the spiced batter gives them a unique taste. Serve with chili sauce, mint yogurt
    sauce, or sweet and sour sauce. Try this recipe with other vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, broccoli, and
    asparagus.</p>

    <li>1 cup chickpea flour</li>

    <li>Sift chickpea flour into a medium bowl; mix in garlic, salt, coriander, turmeric, chili powder, and garam
